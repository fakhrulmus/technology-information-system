## ASSIGNMENTS

### Assignment 1 

  These posters explain about Probased, a project-based learning application system that
can be used either for students or lecturers. Probased supports project-based learning activities by
simplifying the administration process of the method, and also providing efficient assessment
tools. This application system can help many students and lecturers to manage their abundant
project-based learning activities in a single application. They can automate the administrative
process in Project-Based learning including project submission, motivation test, problem solving
test and peer review using 360 Degree measurement which includes lecturer, supervisor and
subordinate. This is very helpful for students to make sure all group members participate in the
group assignment. From this activity, I learned that this application system is very convenient
and beneficial for both students and lecturers. With this application, students can get more
familiar with the professional practice and educate them about the real project situation. This will
aid them to be more prepared in the future as they are going to handle bigger projects in real life
situations, increasing student motivation and their problem solving skills. Moreover , I believe
this activity will spark excitement among students, especially students in UTM. The NALI 2023
event, as well as the interview sessions, make it much easier for me to understand the course
material thoroughly. There are various interesting facts and extensive explanations about
technological innovation that made students keen and curious to learn more deeper, particularly
in ICT courses.

### Assignment 2 
It was a great experience with
Clarity Techwork
. One of the inspiring talks by Mr. Yee Soon Tuck himself, the
Chief Technology Officer
(CTO) of the company, was that he did not even have degree qualifications when hestarted working in IT. This reminds us that in order to get a job, not only we have to rely on theoreticalknowledge but also practical knowledge. Besides, attitude is important since it is one of the most importantaspects of working in an environment. We see this talk as an advantage for the students to expose themselvesto their career jobs in the future. This allows them to develop their cohesive skills and responsibilities.

### Assignment 3 ( UTM digital Visit )

  Participating in these activities was really beneficial. We got to visit the UTM Digital data center for the first time, seeing our university's data storage and learning about the information and technology used there. During the industry visit, they introduced their team, and we were impressed by the large group working together to maintain the university's technology system.

### Assignment 4 

  Ms. Qistina Azman gave a thoughtful talk on system development that gave us a thorough grasp of its useful applications in real-world situations. With the goal of becoming a System Developer within the next four years, I understand the need of ongoing education and research, particularly in light of the swift pace of technological progress. The thorough comprehension obtained from the discussion has reaffirmed the significance of ongoing education and flexibility in a quickly changing technology environment. It is now clear that success in this profession requires more than just technical knowledge, highlighting the critical role that strong teamwork plays in overseeing complex projects. A sense of purpose sparks by realizing that my goals demand constant effort and devotion. Moreover, I recognize the importance of collaboration in overseeing extensive and intricate tasks. I have faith that if I put in constant effort and attention, I will succeed in this industry.

### Pc assemble

  A well-rounded computer science student should possess a comprehensive understanding of various aspects within the realm of computers, extending beyond just programming and application development. In our PC assembly module, we've acquired skills in assembling and disassembling computers, including tasks such as removing RAM, power supplies, and various other components. With this proficiency, I believe I've reached a decent level of competence as a computer science student.
