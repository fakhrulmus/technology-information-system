o Pc assemble

A well-rounded computer science student should possess a comprehensive understanding of various aspects within the realm of computers, extending beyond just programming and application development. In our PC assembly module, we've acquired skills in assembling and disassembling computers, including tasks such as removing RAM, power supplies, and various other components. With this proficiency, I believe I've reached a decent level of competence as a computer science student.

o Assignment 3 ( UTM digital Visit )

Participating in these activities was really beneficial. We got to visit the UTM Digital data center for the first time, seeing our university's data storage and learning about the information and technology used there. During the industry visit, they introduced their team, and we were impressed by the large group working together to maintain the university's technology system.
