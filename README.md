## ASSIGNMENTS

### Assignment 1 

In exploring the innovative projects presented at NALI 2023, a common thread of emerging technology's transformative impact on education. From Kahoot! enhancing engagement in commercial law classes to VR revolutionizing architectural learning experiences, e-bike tracking promoting transport resilience, mobile robots fostering programming resilience, to Probased streamlining project-based learning, these initiatives showcase the dynamic intersection of technology and education. The presenters emphasized not only the practical benefits, such as improved understanding and skill development, but also the exciting potential to make learning enjoyable and prepare students for future challenges. As a spectator, I found the event eye-opening, revealing the diverse ways in which technology is shaping the educational landscape and creating a more interactive and stimulating learning environment for students. The fusion of innovation and education showcased at NALI 2023 highlights the promising future of learning methodologies.
  

### Assignment 2 
It was a great experience with
Clarity Techwork
. One of the inspiring talks by Mr. Yee Soon Tuck himself, the
Chief Technology Officer
(CTO) of the company, was that he did not even have degree qualifications when hestarted working in IT. This reminds us that in order to get a job, not only we have to rely on theoreticalknowledge but also practical knowledge. Besides, attitude is important since it is one of the most importantaspects of working in an environment. We see this talk as an advantage for the students to expose themselvesto their career jobs in the future. This allows them to develop their cohesive skills and responsibilities.

### Assignment 3 ( UTM digital Visit )

  Participating in these activities was really beneficial. We got to visit the UTM Digital data center for the first time, seeing our university's data storage and learning about the information and technology used there. During the industry visit, they introduced their team, and we were impressed by the large group working together to maintain the university's technology system.

### Assignment 4 

  Ms. Qistina Azman gave a thoughtful talk on system development that gave us a thorough grasp of its useful applications in real-world situations. With the goal of becoming a System Developer within the next four years, I understand the need of ongoing education and research, particularly in light of the swift pace of technological progress. The thorough comprehension obtained from the discussion has reaffirmed the significance of ongoing education and flexibility in a quickly changing technology environment. It is now clear that success in this profession requires more than just technical knowledge, highlighting the critical role that strong teamwork plays in overseeing complex projects. A sense of purpose sparks by realizing that my goals demand constant effort and devotion. Moreover, I recognize the importance of collaboration in overseeing extensive and intricate tasks. I have faith that if I put in constant effort and attention, I will succeed in this industry.

### Pc assemble

  A well-rounded computer science student should possess a comprehensive understanding of various aspects within the realm of computers, extending beyond just programming and application development. In our PC assembly module, we've acquired skills in assembling and disassembling computers, including tasks such as removing RAM, power supplies, and various other components. With this proficiency, I believe I've reached a decent level of competence as a computer science student.
